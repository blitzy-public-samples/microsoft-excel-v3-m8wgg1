## Overview
This project is a comprehensive implementation of Microsoft Excel, providing powerful spreadsheet functionality across web, desktop, and mobile platforms. It offers a wide range of features for data management, analysis, and visualization.

## Features
- Grid-based interface for data input and manipulation
- Comprehensive formula system with 400+ built-in functions
- Advanced charting and data visualization capabilities
- Pivot Tables and data analysis tools
- Real-time collaboration and cloud integration
- Macro recording and VBA support for automation
- Cross-platform availability (Windows, macOS, web, iOS, and Android)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- npm (v6.x or later)
- For desktop development: 
  - Windows: .NET Core SDK 
  - macOS: Xcode
- For mobile development: 
  - Android: Android Studio
  - iOS: Xcode

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/microsoft/excel.git
   cd excel
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values.

### Running the Application
- Web version:
  ```
  npm run start:web
  ```
- Desktop version:
  ```
  npm run start:desktop
  ```
- Mobile version:
  ```
  npm run start:mobile
  ```

### Troubleshooting
- If you encounter "Module not found" errors, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and running `npm install` again.
- For desktop build issues, ensure you have the correct .NET Core SDK (Windows) or Xcode (macOS) version installed.
- For mobile build issues, verify that Android Studio (Android) or Xcode (iOS) is properly configured with the correct SDKs.

### Reporting Bugs / Requesting Features
- Use the GitHub Issues tab to report bugs or request features.
- For bugs, please provide a clear description, steps to reproduce, and if possible, a minimal code sample.
- For feature requests, describe the feature and its potential benefits to the project.

## Performance Considerations
- For large datasets (100,000+ cells), consider using virtualization techniques for rendering.
- Optimize formula calculations by minimizing volatile functions and using efficient algorithms.
- Use web workers for heavy computations to keep the UI responsive.

## Localization and Internationalization
- All user-facing strings should be wrapped in localization functions.
- Date and number formats should respect the user's locale settings.
- Right-to-left (RTL) language support is available for Arabic and Hebrew.

## Security Considerations
- Never store sensitive data in client-side storage without encryption.
- Use HTTPS for all network communications.
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization to prevent XSS and injection attacks.
- Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Roadmap
- Q3 2023: Implement real-time collaboration features
- Q4 2023: Enhance mobile experience with touch-optimized UI
- Q1 2024: Introduce AI-powered data insights and suggestions
- Q2 2024: Expand third-party integration capabilities
